# Agent guidance — LBA2 Classic Community

This document helps AI coding assistants (Cursor, Copilot, Claude, etc.) work effectively on this codebase. Read it before making changes or answering questions about the code.

## Principles

1. **Truth hierarchy and doc accuracy:** Code > project docs > external sources. Prefer `docs/GLOSSARY.md`, `docs/LIFECYCLES.md`, etc. over inference. When code and docs conflict, code wins — fix the docs in the same commit or PR (environment trumps willpower; maintainers may forget). Keep `docs/ASM_VALIDATION_PROGRESS.md` and `docs/ASM_TO_CPP_REFERENCE.md` current.

2. **Preserve the nature of the game:** Do not change gameplay, feel, or behavior by default. Fix bugs that alter behavior; do not "improve" behavior without explicit agreement.

3. **Optional features behind flags:** New behavior or features that change the experience must be opt-in (build options, config flags, runtime toggles). Default builds should match original behavior.

4. **Quality over speed:** Equivalence tests must pass. Do not relax tests to unblock. Prefer smaller, well-tested changes. Fix bugs before merging.

5. **Cross-platform priority:** Support Linux, macOS, and Windows. Contributors and agents may be on any of these—do not assume Linux. Avoid platform-specific assumptions (paths, case sensitivity, toolchains). Prefer portable C/C++. No inline x86 in library code. The engine builds on SDL3, which supports [many more platforms](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/README-platforms.md)—writing portable code today keeps that door open.

## Never

- Never relax equivalence tests or add approximate comparisons
- Never remove French comments or ASCII art
- Never add `__asm__` / inline x86 in LIB386 C++ files
- Never change gameplay, timing, or feel without explicit approval
- Never assume platform; never add unapproved dependencies
- Never "modernize" C++98 to C++11+ in game code (tests may use newer)
- Never add game assets (art, audio, models, textures) to the repo—they are not redistributable
- Never hardcode API keys, credentials, or secrets
- Never add GPL-incompatible code or dependencies; respect the project license (GPL v2). When copying code from elsewhere, ensure compatibility and proper attribution.
- Never run clang-format on ASM, `LIB386/libsmacker/`, or other excluded files
- Do only what was asked; avoid scope creep (refactoring, "improving" unrelated code)
- When the user's intent is ambiguous, ask before proceeding—do not guess.

## Golden rules

Operational complements to the principles above.

- **ASM is the source of truth.** All equivalence tests compare ASM vs C++ byte-for-byte. Use `ASSERT_ASM_CPP_EQ_INT` for scalars, `ASSERT_ASM_CPP_MEM_EQ` for buffers. See `docs/ASM_TEST_COVERAGE_AUDIT.md` for what "covered" means in practice (branches, side effects, edge inputs, ASM-invalid domains). This applies to ported engine code (LIB386, SOURCES/3DEXT). New SOURCES infrastructure with no ASM original (e.g. console, logging, control harness) is verified by host tests, not ASM equivalence.
- **Think like an archaeologist:** This codebase is a window into 1990s game dev at Adeline Software. Surface historical context when relevant. See `docs/FRENCH_COMMENTS.md` and `docs/ASCII_ART.md`.
- **Search before adding:** Check for existing implementations before adding new code; avoid duplication.
- **Pin fixes with a test or a repro hook.** When fixing a bug, first ask whether the affected logic is pure-data (parsing, serialization, math, projection, sort) — if yes, extracting it into a pure function and adding a host test is usually a small additional refactor and should be done as part of the fix. When automation is impractical (state, timing, UI), ship a manual repro hook instead (a console command, debug menu entry, or build flag). See [CONTRIBUTING.md "Doing good work here"](CONTRIBUTING.md#doing-good-work-here) for the rationale.

## Execution style (Karpathy-inspired)

Apply these behavior rules on every non-trivial task:

1. **Think before coding:** State assumptions explicitly. If intent is ambiguous, ask before implementing. Surface tradeoffs instead of silently picking one path.
2. **Simplicity first:** Prefer the minimum code and the minimum API needed to satisfy the request. Avoid speculative abstractions and "future-proofing" unless requested.
3. **Surgical changes:** Touch only files and lines needed for the requested outcome. Avoid drive-by refactors, formatting churn, or unrelated cleanup.
4. **Goal-driven execution:** Define concrete success criteria (preferably tests or reproducible checks), implement, then verify results before declaring done.

## Project overview

- **What:** Community fork of the LBA2 (Twinsen's Odyssey) engine for preservation and modernization.
- **Main work:** Porting x86 assembly to C++ while preserving exact behavior. ASM remains the source of truth.
- **Stack:** C++98 game logic, LIB386 engine libraries (C linkage), x86 ASM (UASM), SDL3, libsmacker.
- **Structure:** `SOURCES/` = game logic; `LIB386/` = engine (3D, audio, rendering); `docs/` = reference documentation.

## Build & test

- **Build:** `cmake -B build && cmake --build build`. Or use presets for your platform: `cmake --preset <preset> && cmake --build --preset <preset>` — `linux`, `macos_arm64`, `macos_x86_64`, `windows_ucrt64` (see `CMakePresets.json`).
- **Game data:** Retail files are not in the repo. See `docs/GAME_DATA.md`. Set `LBA2_GAME_DIR`, use `--game-dir`, or place data in `./data` / `../LBA2` relative to the repo. From anywhere in the clone: `./scripts/dev/build-and-run.sh` or `make run` (repo root).
- **Tests:** Run via Docker: `./run_tests_docker.sh`. Works on Linux, macOS (Docker + QEMU), and Windows (Docker Desktop). Tests require 32-bit x86 + UASM inside the container.
- **Host tests:** `make test` (or `ctest -L host_quick` after configure with `-DLBA2_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DLBA2_BUILD_ASM_EQUIV_TESTS=OFF`). No Docker, no retail files. CI runs these on Linux, macOS, and Windows (see `.github/workflows/*.yml`).
- **Filter:** `./run_tests_docker.sh test_getang2d test_lirot3df`
- **Bisect:** `./run_tests_docker.sh --bisect` to find first divergent draw call
- **Before considering done:** Run `./run_tests_docker.sh` (or N/A if docs-only). If modifying formatted files: run `bash ./scripts/ci/apply-format.sh` (or enable the pre-commit hook — see "Code conventions"); CI also runs the format check.
- **When tests fail:** Do not relax tests. For ASM↔CPP: use `--bisect` to find first divergence, add debug traces to both ASM and CPP, extract failing inputs into a focused unit test, fix CPP to match ASM. For other bugs: read the relevant subsystem doc (AUDIO, MENU, DEBUG, etc.), map the code path, fix the bug, verify with build/tests.
- **Minimal build** (no audio/video): `-DSOUND_BACKEND=null -DMVIDEO_BACKEND=null` for quick iteration.
- **Switch render resolution at launch:** `--resolution WxH` (e.g. `--resolution 768x480`, `--resolution 1280x720`). Range `320x200` – `1920x1024`, width must be a multiple of 8. Default (no flag) is the compile-time `RESOLUTION_X/Y` (640x480). Useful for sweeping width-dependent bugs from one binary instead of rebuilding per width — see `docs/WIDESCREEN_HARDCODED_DIMS_AUDIT.md`. *Dev-mode for now*: the engine renders correctly, but the 2D UI is still anchored at 640x480 (Tier 2 work).
- **Drive it programmatically:** the CLI control harness boots, restores a save, runs console commands, advances N ticks, and writes a JSON state snapshot / PNG, then exits — in one invocation: `lba2cc --load <save> --tick 30 --dump-state s.json --screenshot s.png --exit`. Use it to verify a runtime change without clicking through the game (compare `--dump-state` before/after — add `--fixed-dt 16` for byte-reproducible dumps so you can assert exact, not just eyeball — or diff a screenshot). Needs retail data + a display; `tests/automation/run.sh` runs the suite. Modal commands (`give <item>`, `playvideo`) hang a `--exit` run — see caveats. See [docs/CONTROL.md](docs/CONTROL.md).

## When modifying X, do Y

| Modifying | Do | See |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| LIB386 C++ port | Check ASM_VALIDATION_PROGRESS Notes; add/update equivalence test | docs/ASM_VALIDATION_PROGRESS.md |
| SOURCES (game logic) | No ASM tests; use docs/GLOSSARY, LIFECYCLES for domain terms | docs/GLOSSARY.md, docs/LIFECYCLES.md |
| SOURCES/3DEXT/ | Same as LIB386; check ASM_TO_CPP_REFERENCE | docs/ASM_TO_CPP_REFERENCE.md |
| Adding ASM↔CPP test | Use `add_asm_cpp_test()`, include stress test, update `docs/ASM_VALIDATION_PROGRESS.md`; check `docs/ASM_TEST_COVERAGE_AUDIT.md` for the coverage rubric | docs/TESTING.md, docs/ASM_TEST_COVERAGE_AUDIT.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md |
| Audio/video | AIL in LIB386/AIL/; backends SDL, Miles, null | docs/AUDIO.md |
| Debug tools | DEBUG_TOOLS (console is always available) | docs/DEBUG.md, docs/CONSOLE.md |
| Verifying a runtime change (scene, hero, inventory, render) | Drive the engine non-interactively and assert on dumped state / a screenshot instead of manual play | docs/CONTROL.md |
| Config / lba2.cfg | Keys, persistence, installer vs game, embedded default | docs/CONFIG.md, docs/GAME_DATA.md |
| Adding a log or diagnostic line | Prefer `Log_*` (`<SYSTEM/LOG.H>`) at the true severity for committed code; `Log_Debug` lands in `adeline.log` but not the in-game console. Throwaway `printf` is fine — don't commit it | "Logging" below, LIB386/H/SYSTEM/LOG.H |
| Code that reads retail HQR data or legacy save formats | Check the rule: never `sizeof(T)`-as-stride for fat structs; use a paired `T_DISK` or field-by-field serialization | docs/ABI.md |
| File with French comments or ASCII art | Preserve; add new comments alongside | docs/FRENCH_COMMENTS.md, docs/ASCII_ART.md |
| New subsystem or doc | Create docs/<name>.md; add to docs/README.md; update in same commit | docs/README.md |
| Any code that affects documented behavior | Update the doc in the same commit | Principle 1 |
| Fixing a bug | If the affected logic is pure-data, extract it to a pure function and add a host test. Otherwise add a manual repro hook (console command, debug flag) | CONTRIBUTING.md "Doing good work here" |
| Editing docs (any `.md`) | Sentence-case headings; bold for structure only (list-item / paragraph leads, table row labels), not mid-sentence emphasis; verify file/line refs; from `docs/`, link to source with `../SOURCES/...` / `../LIB386/...` | "Editing docs" below; CONTRIBUTING.md "Doing good work here" |

## Code conventions

Style rules and rationale (language dialect, indentation, types, C++98, preservation) live in [CODESTYLE.md](CODESTYLE.md) — read it before writing engine code. The agent-critical invariant: **ported original code stays C-style to mirror the ASM; new infrastructure with no ASM original may use conservative C++98 features.** Never modernize game code (see the Never list). When unsure, match the file you are editing.

Formatting mechanics (agent-operational):

- Formatting: clang-format with checked-in `.clang-format`; exclusions live in `.clang-format-ignore` (ASM, `LIB386/libsmacker/`, vendored `stb_*`, and a handful of legacy lookup-table files). When adding vendored third-party code or generated/hand-tuned lookup tables, add the path to `.clang-format-ignore` in the same commit — single source of truth for local scripts, CI, and the pre-commit hook.
- Pre-commit hook (optional, recommended): `git config core.hooksPath scripts/git-hooks` once per clone. It runs clang-format `--dry-run` on staged C/C++ files (respecting `.clang-format-ignore`) and blocks commits with violations. Fix with `bash ./scripts/ci/apply-format.sh && git add -u`. Bypass with `git commit --no-verify` or `SKIP_FORMAT=1` when warranted.

## Logging

One pipe: every log call fans out to `adeline.log` (always), an ANSI terminal when one is attached, and the in-engine console. API in [LIB386/H/SYSTEM/LOG.H](LIB386/H/SYSTEM/LOG.H); design and history in [docs/LOGGING_UNIFICATION.md](docs/LOGGING_UNIFICATION.md). This is about ergonomics, not ceremony — it isn't meant to police throwaway debugging.

- **Pick the true severity.** `Log_Info` / `Log_Warn` / `Log_Error`, plus `Log_Raw` for verbatim lines (no severity tag). Defaults: file and terminal admit `DEBUG`+, the console admits `INFO`+.
- **`Log_Debug` is the everyday detail level.** It reaches `adeline.log` (tail it) but stays off the in-game console; `loglevel debug` surfaces it there. It's varargs like `printf`, so there's no friction reason to prefer `printf` in committed code.
- **Throwaway debugging is your business** — a quick `printf` while iterating is fine; just don't commit it.
- **High-frequency / per-subsystem chatter** (per-sound, per-frame): gate it behind a runtime flag toggled from the console, the way `audio` and `video log` do, rather than logging unconditionally.
- **No log categories/channels** (deliberately — YAGNI). To filter by area, prefix the message text (`[SFX]`, `[CD]`) and grep the file.
- `LogPrintf` / `LogPuts` are legacy shims onto the same fan-out — fine where they are; no need to add new calls.
- **Before the sinks exist** (early boot), `Log_*` falls back to stderr so errors still surface. `stdout` is for data, never logs.

## Editing docs

For tone and engineering principles, see [CONTRIBUTING.md "Doing good work here"](CONTRIBUTING.md#doing-good-work-here). The rules below are the doc-formatting standard on top of that.

**User-facing vs agent-facing.** README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, and most of `docs/` are user-facing — tone matters and the rules below apply. AGENTS.md and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are agent-facing — accuracy and structure for agents to parse matter most; tone and bold density matter less.

**Formatting:**

- Headings: sentence case. Proper nouns, place names, and acronyms keep their capitals (e.g. "MSYS2", "ASM", "Citadel Island", "GitHub release").
- Bold for structure, not emphasis. Keep list-item leads (`- **Foo:** description`), paragraph leads (`**Note:**`, `**Why:**`), and table row labels. Strip mid-sentence emphasis on inline code, product names, and short noun phrases.
- Italics for semantic markers (`*why*`, `*what*`) are fine. Don't italicise for decoration.
- Leave smart quotes (`"…"`) and `--` (double-hyphen) dashes alone — don't normalise.
- Reflow paragraph hard-wraps for consistency: prefer one paragraph per line and one item per list-row. If a doc mixes wrapped and unwrapped paragraphs, reflow.

**Accuracy (always pair with formatting):**

- Verify file paths, line numbers, function names, and command flags against the working tree before believing them.
- From `docs/`, links to `SOURCES/` or `LIB386/` need the `../` prefix (`[…](../SOURCES/X.CPP)`). Common breakage spot.
- Cross-check claims about CMake options, presets, and CI workflows against `CMakeLists.txt`, `CMakePresets.json`, and `.github/workflows/`.

**Special cases:**

- Verbatim attributed external content (e.g. [docs/COMPILER_NOTES.md](docs/COMPILER_NOTES.md)): leave entirely as-is.
- Curated content (`docs/FRENCH_COMMENTS.md`, `docs/ASCII_ART.md`, `docs/ASM_VALIDATION_PROGRESS.md`): light touch only — H1 + the project's own framing prose.

## Commit & PR conventions

The **PR title** drives the changelog. `git-cliff` parses it from the
commit log on `main` regardless of which merge mode you pick (merge,
squash, or rebase), so the title has to follow
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <summary>
```

Allowed types:

| Type       | Use for                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | New feature visible to players or contributors              |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                                     |
| `port`     | ASM → C++ port work (fork-specific, distinct from refactor) |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement, no behavior change                 |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change                      |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                                          |
| `test`     | Adding or tightening tests                                  |
| `build`    | Build system, CMake, presets                                |
| `ci`       | CI workflow plumbing (matrix, runners, labels). For user-facing CI work like a release pipeline that ships binaries, prefer `feat:` so it lands in **Added** where end-users look. |
| `chore`    | Housekeeping — **skipped from the public changelog**        |

Scope is optional but useful (`fix(credits): ...`, `port(SORT): ...`).

A lightweight CI check (`.github/workflows/pr-title.yml`) verifies the PR
title format. **Individual commits inside the PR can be free-form** — only
the PR title is enforced. Contributors do not need to edit `CHANGELOG.md`;
it is regenerated at release time. Use `chore:` for any PR you want kept
out of the public changelog (formatting, tooling, internal cleanups).
See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).

**Do not include `(#issue_num)` in the PR title.** When a PR is
squash-merged, GitHub appends `(#PR_num)` to the resulting commit subject
— if the title already contained `(#issue_num)`, the commit ends up with
both: e.g. `fix(credits): ... (#65) (#66)`. Reference issues in the PR
*body* instead, using GitHub's standard keywords (`Closes #65`,
`Fixes #65`, `Refs #65`).
