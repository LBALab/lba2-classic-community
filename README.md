# Little Big Adventure 2 - Engine source code - Community

Little Big Adventure 2 (aka Twinsen's Odyssey) is the sequel of Little Big Adventure (aka Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure) in 1997.

We are releasing this code with preservation in mind, as this piece of work was exceptional for the time and we believe it can be a valuable source of education.

The engine uses Assembly code and was originally compiled with non-open source libraries which have been excluded from the project.

## About this repository

The **original** LBA2 engine source is the **lba2-classic** codebase: it is mostly assembly, with C++ for game logic, and is the canonical historical release. **lba2-classic-community** is a **community fork** for evolving and modernizing the code: ports of assembly to C++, SDL3, libsmacker, and other updates. The goal is to preserve the history and culture of the original while making the codebase easier to build and extend. See [ASM_TO_CPP_REFERENCE.md](docs/ASM_TO_CPP_REFERENCE.md) for which modules have been ported from ASM to C++ in this fork.

## Quick start (running the game)

### First clone

1. **Dependencies:** CMake (3.23+), a C/C++ compiler, **SDL3**. The repo **`Makefile`** also expects **Ninja** on `PATH`. You can skip the Makefile and use plain CMake with your preferred generator instead.
2. **`make`** or **`make help`** — lists convenience targets (`build`, `run`, `clean`, `test`, …).
3. **`make build`** — configures `build/` (Ninja, Debug) and compiles `lba2`. Or: `cmake -B build && cmake --build build` (default generator is fine if you do not use `make build`).
4. **Retail game data** are not in this repo. You need a directory that contains **`lba2.hqr`**. How you point the engine at it is **your choice**: `export LBA2_GAME_DIR=/path`, **`./data/`** (gitignored), **`--game-dir`**, or bounded automatic discovery — see [docs/GAME_DATA.md](docs/GAME_DATA.md). Nothing is “special-cased” except that marker file.
5. **`make run`** or **`./scripts/dev/build-and-run.sh`** — build if needed, then run (exits with a clear message if no valid data directory was found).
6. **`make test`** (alias for **`make test-discovery`**) — host-only tests for path resolution and embedded default config; **no** retail files or Docker required.

**Windows:** Use **MSYS2** (recommended; see [docs/WINDOWS.md](docs/WINDOWS.md)). Discovery and the game work the same (`LBA2_GAME_DIR`, `--game-dir`, paths with `\` or `/`). The root **`Makefile`** and **`scripts/dev/*.sh`** need a **Unix-like shell** (MSYS2 UCRT64, Git Bash, or WSL); alternatively run **`cmake`** and **`build/SOURCES/lba2.exe`** from **cmd.exe** / PowerShell and set the env var with `set LBA2_GAME_DIR=...`.

### Build and run (reference)

```bash
cmake -B build && cmake --build build
./build/SOURCES/lba2
```

With optional game data path: `./build/SOURCES/lba2 --game-dir /path/to/classic/install` or set **`LBA2_GAME_DIR`** first.

**`make run`** sets **`LBA2_GAME_DIR`** automatically if **`./data`** or **`../LBA2`** contains `lba2.hqr`.

Run **`make`** for convenience targets: **`make build`**, **`make clean`** (removes the default **`build/`** tree; override with **`BUILD_DIR`**), **`make test`**, **`make test-docker`**, etc.

## Prerequisites

- **CMake** 3.23 or later
- **Ninja** build system for CMake preset-based builds
- **UASM** assembler (used for x86 assembly sources)
- **SDL3** (shared library)
- A C/C++ compiler with C++98 support (GCC, Clang)

On macOS, install Ninja with:

```bash
brew install ninja
```

## Building

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

By default, the build uses SDL for audio and libsmacker for FMV playback. Override with `-DSOUND_BACKEND=null -DMVIDEO_BACKEND=null` for a minimal (silent, no video) build.

### Using CMake presets

This repository provides CMake presets for common configurations in `CMakePresets.json`. You can use them instead of specifying the build directory and toolchain flags manually:

All presets use the `Ninja` generator, so `ninja` must be installed and
available on `PATH`.

- **Linux (native build)**:

  ```bash
  cmake --preset linux
  cmake --build --preset linux
  ```

- **macOS (native build)**:

  ```bash
  cmake --preset macos_arm64   # or macos_x86_64
  cmake --build --preset macos_arm64
  ```

- **Windows (native build with MSYS2)** - See [docs/WINDOWS.md](docs/WINDOWS.md) for detailed instructions:

  ```bash
  cmake --preset windows_ucrt64    # recommended for Windows 10+
  cmake --build --preset windows_ucrt64
  ```

- **Cross-compiling Windows from Linux**:

  ```bash
  cmake --preset cross_linux2win
  cmake --build --preset cross_linux2win
  ```

### Build Options

| Option | Values | Default | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `SOUND_BACKEND` | `null`, `miles`, `sdl` | `sdl` | Sound backend. Use `sdl` for audio via SDL3. `miles` requires the proprietary Miles Sound System SDK. See [docs/AUDIO.md](docs/AUDIO.md). |
| `MVIDEO_BACKEND` | `null`, `smacker` | `smacker` | Motion video backend. Use `smacker` for FMV playback via the bundled open-source libsmacker. |
| `DEBUG_TOOLS` | `ON`, `OFF` | `OFF` | Enable original Adeline developer debug tools. See [docs/DEBUG.md](docs/DEBUG.md). |
| `LBA2_BUILD_TESTS` | `ON`, `OFF` | `OFF` | Build CTest targets (ASM equivalence + host tests such as `test_res_discovery`). |
| `LBA2_BUILD_ASM_EQUIV_TESTS` | `ON`, `OFF` | `ON` | ASM↔CPP equivalence suite (needs `objcopy`). Set `OFF` for host-only `test_res_discovery` (e.g. macOS CI, `make test-discovery`). |

When `MVIDEO_BACKEND` is set to `smacker`, the build links in `libsmacker` and the FMV player. Video audio routes through the active sound backend (SDL: real audio; NULL/MILES: silent). See `LIB386/SMACKER/README.md` and `LIB386/AIL/MILES/README.md` for details on the proprietary SDKs and their open-source replacements.

### Debug Tools

To build with the original Adeline developer debug tools enabled:

```bash
cmake -B build -DDEBUG_TOOLS=ON
cmake --build build
```

This enables keyboard shortcuts for debugging (debug overlay, FPS counter, screenshots, collision visualization, benchmarks), cheat codes, bug save/load system, and command-line scene selection. See [docs/DEBUG.md](docs/DEBUG.md) for full documentation.

### Debug Console

This source port includes a Quake-style drop-down debug console. It lets you inspect engine/game state and run developer commands during gameplay, which is useful for both debugging and interactive exploration of engine behavior.

It is designed to be minimally invasive: normal gameplay is unchanged unless you open and use it.

See [docs/CONSOLE.md](docs/CONSOLE.md) for commands, usage, and integration details.

### Cross-compiling for Windows (from Linux)

A MinGW toolchain file is provided for cross-compiling a 32-bit Windows build from Linux:

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/mingw-w64-i686.cmake
cmake --build build
```

## Preservation Notes

This codebase is a window into 1990s game development at Adeline Software International in Lyon, France. Beyond the technical content, the source files contain original developer artifacts worth exploring. The ASCII art and French comments documented below are from the **original** Adeline / lba2-classic codebase (same files or content preserved when porting ASM to C++ in this fork).

- **ASCII art banners** -- The developers decorated their source files with elaborate text banners in two distinct styles. See [ASCII_ART.md](docs/ASCII_ART.md) for a full catalog.
- **French comments** -- The code is written with French comments throughout, many of which are informal, humorous, or expressive in ways that reflect the personality of the team. See [FRENCH_COMMENTS.md](docs/FRENCH_COMMENTS.md) for a curated selection with English translations.
