#   ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/VERSION_GENERATED.h      — defines LBA2_VERSION_STRING
#                                                  and LBA2_COMMIT_STRING
#                                                  (included by BUILD_INFO.h).
#
# Source of truth is the `VERSION` file at the repo root. See
# `cmake/write_version.cmake` for the resolution logic.
#
# Note on the .txt extension on the plain-text output: the build dir is
# on lba2's include path (BUILD_INFO.h is generated there). On macOS
# (default case-insensitive APFS/HFS+), a C++ header search for
# `<version>` (a real libc++ feature-test header since C++20) would
# otherwise resolve to `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/VERSION` and clang would try
# to compile the plain-text file as C++. The `.txt` extension makes the
# collision impossible.
