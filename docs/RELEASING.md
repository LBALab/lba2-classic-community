# Releasing

Short maintainer recipe for cutting a release.

## Versioning

The engine uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The fork is
pre-1.0 while crashes are still being ironed out.

| Bump  | When                                                                |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MAJOR | Save-format break, hard removal of a build option, or `1.0` itself  |
| MINOR | New feature, new platform support, opt-in behavior change           |
| PATCH | Bugfix or doc-only release                                          |

### `1.0.0` bar

`1.0.0` is reached when:

- **All original features are implemented and working** — feature parity with
  the retail game, no functional gaps.
- The fork has had **at least a few rounds of community play-tests** to
  surface remaining issues against a real playthrough.
- Equivalence and host tests pass on Linux, macOS, and Windows in CI.

Until then, MINOR releases ship features and platform progress; PATCH
releases ship fixes. Don't wait for `1.0` to bump versions — there's
plenty of new work in the fork already, and incremental `0.x` releases
keep momentum.

### Engine version vs `NUM_VERSION`

These are independent:

- **Engine version** (`v0.9.0`, `v1.0.0`, ...) — the semver tag this doc is about.
- **`NUM_VERSION`** in `SOURCES/COMMON.H` — the save-file on-disk format
  version (currently `36`). Bumping the engine version does not bump
  `NUM_VERSION`, and vice versa. See
  [issue #64](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/issues/64) for
  the canonical save-format work tracked separately.

## Cutting a release

The flow differs slightly between the very first tagged release and every
release after it. The difference is whether `git-cliff` should generate
the section content (subsequent releases) or the existing hand-curated
`[Unreleased]` section is the content (first release).

### First release (`v0.9.0`)

The current `[Unreleased]` section in `CHANGELOG.md` is hand-curated — it
narrates everything shipped since the fork was created and is the
canonical content for `v0.9.0`. Do not run `git cliff -o` here; it
would replace the narrative with a sparse auto-generated section (most
pre-tag commits are not conventional-commit-formatted). Just promote the
heading.

The version number itself lives in the `VERSION` file at the repo
root. CMake reads it, embeds it in the binary, and writes it to
`build/VERSION.txt` for release pipelines (PR #74) to consume. So a release
cut also bumps that file: `0.9.0-dev` → `0.9.0` for the release commit,
then `0.10.0-dev` for the next development cycle.

```bash
VERSION=v0.9.0
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# 1. In CHANGELOG.md, change:
#      ## [Unreleased]
#    to:
#      ## [Unreleased]
#      _Nothing yet._
#
#      ## [0.9.0] - YYYY-MM-DD
#
#    Update the compare link at the bottom of the file:
#      [Unreleased]: .../compare/main...HEAD
#    becomes:
#      [Unreleased]: .../compare/v0.9.0...HEAD
#      [0.9.0]:      .../compare/<initial-commit-sha>...v0.9.0

# 2. Bump VERSION file: 0.9.0-dev -> 0.9.0
echo "0.9.0" > VERSION

# 3. Review, commit, tag, push.
git diff CHANGELOG.md VERSION
git add CHANGELOG.md VERSION
git commit -m "chore(release): $VERSION"
git tag -a "$VERSION" -m "Release $VERSION"
git push origin main
git push origin "$VERSION"

# 4. Sanity-check the binary picks it up.
cmake --build build
./build/SOURCES/lba2cc --version    # expect: 0.9.0
cat build/VERSION.txt                  # expect: 0.9.0

# 5. Bump VERSION for next development cycle: 0.9.0 -> 0.10.0-dev
echo "0.10.0-dev" > VERSION
git add VERSION
git commit -m "chore: bump VERSION to 0.10.0-dev"
git push origin main
```

`git-cliff` is not required for the first release.

### Subsequent releases

From the second release on, `git cliff --prepend` adds a new versioned
section to the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, generated from PR titles since the
previous tag. Existing content (including the hand-curated v0.9.0
narrative) stays untouched.

```bash
VERSION=v0.10.0

# 1. Prepend the new section. NOTE: --prepend, not -o (which would
#    overwrite the entire file). GITHUB_TOKEN is required: the body
#    template renders one entry per PR using the PR title resolved from
#    the GitHub API. Without a token, no entries render.
GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" git cliff --tag "$VERSION" --prepend CHANGELOG.md

# 2. Review the new section at the top. Hand-curate if useful (group
#    highlights, link to docs).
git diff CHANGELOG.md

# 3. Add a compare link at the bottom of the file:
#      [v0.10.0]: .../compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0

# 4. Commit, tag, push.
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore(release): $VERSION"
git tag -a "$VERSION" -m "Release $VERSION"
git push origin main
git push origin "$VERSION"
```

**Why `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required.** The template renders one entry per
PR using `commit.remote.pr_title` and `commit.remote.pr_number`, which
cliff fetches from the GitHub API for each commit. This is what gives a
single clean entry per PR regardless of merge mode (squash, merge-commit,
or rebase). Without a token, those fields are empty and no entries
render. Use a token with public read scope only.

## GitHub release

A git tag is just a pointer to a commit. A GitHub Release is a
separate object layered *on top of* a tag — it adds the user-facing
Releases-page entry (`/releases/tag/v0.9.0`), a title and rendered
release notes, optional binary attachments, and an RSS feed (`/releases.atom`)
that auto-update tools watch. Pushing the tag without creating a Release
means it shows up under "Tags" but not "Releases" — most browsers and
tools only look at the latter.

### Drafting the release

Two equivalent paths.

**CLI (recommended for repeatability):**

```bash
# Extract the v0.9.0 section from CHANGELOG.md into a notes file
sed -n '/^## \[0\.9\.0\]/,/^## \[/{/^## \[/!p;}' CHANGELOG.md > /tmp/release-notes.md

# Create the GitHub Release from the existing tag
gh release create v0.9.0 --title "v0.9.0" --notes-file /tmp/release-notes.md
```

**Web UI:** Releases → Draft a new release → pick the `v0.9.0` tag →
paste the v0.9.0 section from `CHANGELOG.md` as the body → Publish.

For v0.9.0 there are no binary attachments yet. The release-binary
workflow is tracked in
[issue #46](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/issues/46)
and [PR #74](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/74)
(Linux AppImages). Source-only releases are valid; players build from
source per the [README](../README.md).

For future releases, `gh release create --generate-notes` auto-fills
the body from PR titles since the previous tag — useful as a sanity
check against the cliff-generated CHANGELOG section.

Once the binary attachments have landed (the per-platform release
workflows finish on a tag in a few minutes each), run the
[post-release smoke test](#post-release-smoke-test) before announcing
the release. A 30-second sanity check that confirms the artifacts
GitHub serves are actually runnable on a clean box.

## Post-release smoke test

After a tag-driven release publishes its artifacts, run:

```bash
bash scripts/dev/verify-release.sh v0.9.0   # or `latest` for rolling
```

The script downloads the Linux tarballs and AppImages attached to the
release, extracts them, and runs each binary in a clean
`debian:stable-slim` container with no SDL3 / X11 / audio deps
installed. Verifies the unique signal CI doesn't cover: the artifact
GitHub *serves* (post-upload, post-download) actually runs on a fresh
system, executable bit preserved and static-linking claim holding.
Cross-arch tarballs are checked via qemu-user-static binfmt (auto-registered);
cross-arch AppImages are skipped because qemu doesn't handle the AppImage
type-2 runtime stub reliably.

Windows ZIPs and macOS DMGs aren't checked — running them on a Linux
host needs `wine` / `qemu-system-x86` / a Mac, which is more
machinery than the marginal signal justifies.

Use this as a pre-publicize gate: a tagged release that passes the
local verifier is safe to announce on Discord.

## After the release

Don't announce until the [smoke test](#post-release-smoke-test) passes.
Then tell people — a short Discord post in the LBALab community
channel helps the release land:

```
v0.9.0 is out — first tagged release of the fork.

Changelog: https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
Release: https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/releases/tag/v0.9.0

No binaries yet — that's coming via #74 (AppImages) and follow-ups for
macOS/Windows. For now, build from source per the README.
```

### Natural follow-ups

These become unblocked once `v0.9.0` is tagged:

- **Linux AppImages**
  ([PR #74](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/74))
  and macOS/Windows release pipelines. They consume `build/VERSION.txt`
  to name artifacts.
- **Optional GitHub repo setting:** Settings → General → "Default to
  PR title for merge commits". Turning it on makes merge-commit
  subjects in the git log match the PR title. Cosmetic — cliff handles
  both formats already.

## How the binary knows its version

The `VERSION` file at the repo root is the single source of truth.
CMake reads it at build time and produces:

- **`build/VERSION.txt`** — plain text, the resolved version. Release
  pipelines (PR #74) `cat` this to name artifacts.
- **`LBA2_VERSION_STRING` macro** in `build/VERSION_GENERATED.h`,
  pulled in via `BUILD_INFO.h`. The game banner (`Version` in
  `SOURCES/VERSION.CPP`) and `./lba2cc --version` both read it.

If git is available and the working tree has uncommitted changes, the
resolved version is suffixed with `-dirty`. So:

| Build context | `./lba2cc --version` |
|---|---|
| Tarball (no `.git`) | `0.9.0-dev` (whatever the file says) |
| Clean dev clone | `0.9.0-dev` |
| Dev clone with uncommitted changes | `0.9.0-dev-dirty` |
| At a release commit (file says `0.9.0`) | `0.9.0` |

The maintainer bumps the `VERSION` file as part of cutting a release
(see step 2 in the recipe above). After the bump-and-commit lands on
`main`, `./lba2cc --version` reports the real semver.

## Product metadata overrides

Release-facing strings (executable name, runtime window title,
`.desktop` entry, AppImage label) all flow from one place: the `LBA2_*`
cache variables in the root `CMakeLists.txt`. Override any of them at
configure time and every surface follows.

| Cache variable             | Default                         | Used by                                                    |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LBA2_EXECUTABLE_NAME`     | `lba2cc`                        | binary name, `.desktop` `Exec=` / `StartupWMClass`         |
| `LBA2_PRODUCT_NAME`        | `LBA2 Classic Community`        | window title (with version), `.desktop` `Name`, AppImage   |
| `LBA2_PRODUCT_NAME_DEMO`   | `LBA2 Twinsen's Odyssey Demo`   | window title when built with `-DDEMO`                      |
| `LBA2_PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION` | (one-line fork description)     | `.desktop` `Comment`                                       |
| `LBA2_DESKTOP_ID`          | `lba2cc`                        | `.desktop` filename stem and `Icon=` value                 |

Example — produce an alternate-branded build:

```bash
cmake -B build \
      -DLBA2_PRODUCT_NAME="LBA2 Anniversary Build" \
      -DLBA2_EXECUTABLE_NAME=lba2-anniv
cmake --build build
```

The window title bar reads `LBA2 Anniversary Build <version>`, the
binary lands at `build/SOURCES/lba2-anniv`, and the generated
`build/packaging/lba2cc.desktop` carries the matching `Name=` and
`Exec=` entries. The AppImage script (`scripts/packaging/make-appimage.sh`)
sources `build/packaging/appimage_env.sh` so its outputs follow too.

> **Note on `LBA2_DESKTOP_ID`.** Icon assets are committed under
> `packaging/lba2cc.{png,ico}`. If you override `LBA2_DESKTOP_ID` (say
> to `lba2-anniv`), the AppImage script looks for `packaging/<id>.png`,
> the Windows resource for `packaging/<id>.ico`, and the macOS bundle
> for an `<id>.icns` generated from `<id>.png`; all three require a
> matching source file in `packaging/`. The binary, window title, and
> `.desktop` entry don't need an icon and follow overrides cleanly on
> their own.

### Renaming the default binary (rare)

Overriding `LBA2_EXECUTABLE_NAME` per-build (above) is the common case.
Bumping the cache *default* — actually changing the project's shipped
binary name — has happened once (`lba2` → `lba2cc` for retail-collision
reasons; see [PR #94](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/94)).
The CMake change is one line; the doc and CI sweep is most of the work,
and easy to underestimate.

If it ever happens again, run **three** greps — each catches a different
class of reference, and a single combined grep will leave stale mentions
behind:

```bash
OLD=lba2 NEW=lba2new   # adjust

# 1. Build/output paths in CI workflows, scripts, READMEs.
grep -rnE "build/SOURCES/$OLD|out/build/.+/SOURCES/$OLD" .

# 2. Bare invocations in docs (./lba2 --version, ./lba2 42).
#    Most error-prone because the token also appears in lba2.cfg,
#    lba2.hqr, LBA2_* env vars, and brand mentions — filter the
#    false positives, don't skip the grep.
grep -rnE "(\./|\s)$OLD( |\$|\.exe)" --include="*.md" --include="*.sh" .

# 3. CMake target references in workflows, Makefiles, scripts.
grep -rnE "target $OLD" .github/workflows scripts/ Makefile
```

Don't forget the `Verify Binary` step in `.github/workflows/{linux,macos,windows}.yml`
— it's a separate `test -f` line that pattern (1) catches but is
easy to miss visually because it lives outside the build step.

After substituting, rebuild with `make build` to confirm the binary
lands at the new path, then re-run all three greps with the **new**
name to catch typos and partial substitutions.

## Release workflow conventions

Every per-platform release workflow under `.github/workflows/release-*.yml`
follows the same shape so artifacts land predictably regardless of which
platform fires first, and adding a new platform is a copy-and-fill exercise:

| Concern | Convention |
|---|---|
| **Triggers** | `push: tags: ['v*']` + `workflow_dispatch:`. Tags do real releases; dispatch is for validation runs. |
| **Job structure** | Two jobs: `build` (matrix, even if 1×1) → `release`. The `build` job is a `uses:` call into `.github/workflows/reusable-build-<platform>.yml` — all toolchain setup, configure, build, and bundle steps live there so `release-latest.yml` can share them. Reusables live at the top level of `.github/workflows/`; GitHub Actions rejects `workflow_call` files in subdirectories. `fail-fast: false` so one arch failing doesn't drop others. |
| **Artifact handoff** | Reusable build legs use `actions/upload-artifact@v7` with `name: <artifact-prefix>-<arch>`, where `artifact-prefix` is a workflow input. Tag callers leave it at the default (`AppImage`, `LinuxTarball`, `Windows`, `macOS`); `release-latest.yml` overrides to `latest-*`. The release job downloads via `pattern: '<prefix>-*' merge-multiple: true`. |
| **Release upload** | `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` with `generate_release_notes: true`. Idempotent — first platform creates the Release, the rest attach. |
| **Tag-only upload** | Release job is gated by `if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')`. `workflow_dispatch` produces downloadable artifacts via the build job's upload step but does not touch the Releases page (avoids creating a "release" named after a branch). |
| **Artifact naming** | `<exe>-<version>-<platform>-<arch>.<ext>`, e.g. `lba2cc-0.9.0-windows-x64.zip`, `lba2cc-0.9.0-AppImage-x86_64.AppImage`, `lba2cc-0.9.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`. |
| **Version source** | `build/VERSION.txt`, generated by `cmake/git_version.cmake` from the canonical `VERSION` file. Read once after configure. |
| **Packaging logic** | Lives under `scripts/packaging/` (`make-appimage.sh`, `bundle-linux-tarball.sh`, `bundle-windows.sh`, `bundle-macos.sh`). One script per platform; the workflow is glue. |

When adding a new platform, copy the closest existing workflow, swap the
runner / toolchain / packaging script, and the rest of the shape carries
over. The next section spells the steps out.

## Adding a new release target

The release infra is split so adding a platform is mechanical: a packaging
script + a reusable build workflow + a thin caller + one matrix leg in
`release-latest.yml`. Concrete order:

1. **Packaging script** — `scripts/packaging/bundle-<platform>.sh` (or a
   monolithic `make-<platform>.sh` for AppImage-style targets that do
   their own configure+build inside the script). Takes built artifact,
   version, arch, build-dir, and output-dir as `--flag` arguments;
   produces the release artifact under the output dir. Naming:
   `lba2cc-<version>-<platform>-<arch>.<ext>`. The existing scripts are
   the templates — Windows is the cleanest split-bundle pattern, AppImage
   is the monolithic pattern, macOS shows bundle-with-platform-metadata,
   tarball is the simplest pure-cmake bundle.
2. **Configured templates** *(optional)* — `scripts/packaging/<platform>-readme.txt.in`
   for an in-archive README, `packaging/<template>.in` for `Info.plist`-
   style configure-time substitution. Wire via `configure_file()` in
   CMake.
3. **Local dry-run** *(optional but recommended)* —
   `scripts/dev/build-<platform>-release.sh` that runs the same configure
   + build + bundle locally without GitHub Actions. Lets contributors
   exercise the artifact path without pushing a branch.
4. **Reusable build workflow** —
   `.github/workflows/reusable-build-<platform>.yml`. Must live at the
   top level of `.github/workflows/`; GHA rejects `workflow_call`
   workflows in subdirectories. Copy the nearest sibling and swap
   runner / preset / toolchain setup / bundle script invocation. Keep
   the `workflow_call` trigger, the `artifact-prefix` input, and the
   `upload-artifact` step using
   `name: ${{ inputs.artifact-prefix }}-${{ matrix.arch }}` — that's the
   contract the release jobs rely on.

   If your target uses `libsdl-org/setup-sdl` **and** has a multi-arch
   matrix, set `discriminator: ${{ runner.arch }}` under the `with:`
   block. setup-sdl's cache key only includes `os.platform()` (Linux /
   MacOS / Windows), not arch, so multi-arch runners on the same OS
   collide on the cache and one leg pulls a wrong-arch `libSDL3.a`,
   breaking the link step. The Linux tarball reusable already does this;
   it's the only current target that hits the multi-arch-with-setup-sdl
   shape (AppImage uses an Arch container, Windows uses MSYS2 pacman,
   macOS is single-arch arm64). Re-add to macOS if a universal2 / Intel
   leg lands; same for any AppImage variant that drops the container.
5. **Thin caller** — `.github/workflows/release-<platform>.yml`:
   `on: push: tags: ['v*'] + workflow_dispatch`, a `build` job that just
   `uses:` the reusable, and a `release` job gated by
   `if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')` that downloads via
   `pattern: '<Platform>-*'` and runs `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`.
   ~25 lines total — `release-windows.yml` is the cleanest example.

   **Build steps belong in the reusable, never in the thin caller.** Any
   configure/build/bundle step you add only to `release-<platform>.yml`
   will not run when `release-latest.yml` builds the rolling pre-release,
   so the tagged and rolling artifacts will diverge silently. If you
   need a step for one caller only, gate it inside the reusable on a
   `workflow_call` input rather than splitting it across files.
6. **`release-latest.yml`** — add a `build-<platform>` job that calls the
   reusable with `with: artifact-prefix: latest-<platform>`. Add to the
   `release.needs:` list and the file glob to the `release.files:` block.
7. **Conventions table** — add an artifact-name row to the table above
   showing the exact `<exe>-<version>-<platform>-<arch>.<ext>` for the
   new target.
8. **CHANGELOG** — entry under `[Unreleased]`.

What CMake might need touching: configure-time templates
(`configure_file(... Info.plist.in ...)`), per-target properties
(`MACOSX_BUNDLE`-style), or a new flag if the platform needs a build
mode the existing `LBA2_LINK_STATIC` toggle doesn't cover. Keep platform
specifics behind a `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` check, not a new option.

**Testing the new target before tagging:**

- Local dry-run produces an artifact identical in shape to what CI will.
- `gh workflow run release-<platform>.yml --ref <branch>` triggers a
  `workflow_dispatch` validation run. Build job runs, artifact uploads,
  release job is skipped by the tag gate. Download the artifact from the
  run page and exercise it.
- For the rolling-release leg: push a no-op commit to a fork's `main`
  and confirm `release-latest.yml` picks up the new leg and includes its
  glob in the rolling release.
- Cut a `v0.X.Y-rc1` pre-release tag once dispatch validation passes —
  exercises the full tag path end-to-end without committing to a stable
  version.

## Rolling latest pre-release

`.github/workflows/release-latest.yml` is a deliberate exception to the
"tags only" convention above. It triggers on every `push: branches: [main]`
and force-overwrites a `latest` GitHub Release with the just-built
artifacts. Marked `prerelease: true` and `make_latest: false` so the most
recent stable tag (e.g. `v0.9.0`) keeps GitHub's "Latest" badge — the
rolling release sits below it, clearly labeled.

| Aspect | Difference from the per-tag releases |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | `push: branches: [main]` (vs `push: tags: ['v*']`) |
| **Tag** | Static `latest`, force-moved to current commit on every push |
| **Pre-release flag** | Always `true` (vs always `false` for versioned tags) |
| **`make_latest`** | `false` (vs default — versioned tags get GitHub's "Latest" promotion) |
| **Concurrency** | Single `release-latest` group, `cancel-in-progress: true`. Back-to-back commits don't queue; newest wins. |
| **Partial release on failure** | `if: always() && !cancelled()` on the release job. If one platform's build leg fails, the rolling release still updates with the platforms that succeeded. Tag releases are stricter (`if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')`) because a tagged release is meant to be complete. |

Same packaging scripts (`make-appimage.sh`, `bundle-linux-tarball.sh`,
`bundle-windows.sh`, `bundle-macos.sh`), same artifact shape, same
naming. The rolling release is functionally a tag-release at HEAD-of-main
with a moving tag instead of a fixed semver.

**When to point users at it:** for community testers who want to
verify a fix on `main` without building from source, or for "does this
reproduce on the latest main?" bug-report triage. Otherwise prefer
linking to a versioned release (stable, immutable, won't change under
their feet between two clicks).

## Linux tarball release artifact (local dry-run)

The Linux tarball is the static-binary alternative to the AppImage —
same binary contents, no AppImage runtime, no desktop integration. For
users on distros where AppImage friction matters (no FUSE, immutable
distros, packagers wrapping the binary), and for "is this a clean-binary
issue?" triage.

```bash
bash scripts/dev/build-linux-tarball.sh
```

Configures the `linux` preset with `-DLBA2_LINK_STATIC=ON`, builds,
and calls `scripts/packaging/bundle-linux-tarball.sh` to produce
`dist/lba2cc-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`. Arch label comes from
`uname -m`, so x86_64 hosts produce `x86_64` artifacts and aarch64 hosts
produce `aarch64`.

Tarball layout:

```
lba2cc-<version>-linux-<arch>/
    lba2cc            ← statically linked: no libSDL3.so, no libsmacker.so
    README.txt        ← LF line endings, populated from
                        scripts/packaging/linux-readme.txt.in
    LICENSE.txt       ← GPL-2.0 from repo root
```

Three files, deliberately. No icon, no `.desktop`, no install script —
users who want desktop integration grab the AppImage. The bundle
script's `ldd` audit flags any non-glibc-family shared dependency that
slipped through static linking.

**Local SDL3 caveat.** Most distros ship SDL3 as a shared library only,
and `-DLBA2_LINK_STATIC=ON` requires the SDL3-static target — so with
only a shared SDL3 installed, `find_package(SDL3)` fails outright. To
produce a truly static binary locally, build SDL3 from source with the
same flags CI uses and pass its prefix via `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` (CMake
picks it up natively from the environment):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch release-3.2.16 \
    https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL /tmp/SDL
cmake -S /tmp/SDL -B /tmp/SDL/build -G Ninja \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DSDL_STATIC=ON -DSDL_SHARED=OFF \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/sdl3-static-prefix
cmake --build /tmp/SDL/build && cmake --install /tmp/SDL/build

CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/tmp/sdl3-static-prefix \
    bash scripts/dev/build-linux-tarball.sh
```

CI does the same dance via `libsdl-org/setup-sdl` with `-DSDL_STATIC=ON
-DSDL_SHARED=OFF` (see `.github/workflows/release-linux-tarball.yml`).
A genuinely-static tarball's `ldd` output shows only `linux-vdso`,
`libc`, `libm`, and the loader — no SDL3, no libsmacker.

## macOS release artifact (local dry-run)

On a macOS box (Apple Silicon or Intel):

```bash
bash scripts/dev/build-macos-release.sh
```

Auto-detects host arch and picks the matching CMake preset (`macos_arm64`
or `macos_x86_64`), configures with `-DLBA2_LINK_STATIC=ON`, builds, and
calls `scripts/packaging/bundle-macos.sh` to produce `dist/lba2cc-<version>-macos-<arch>.dmg`.
Override the auto-detection with `--preset macos_x86_64` if you want to
build x86_64 on Apple Silicon (Rosetta-friendly Xcode required).

Requires macOS host — uses `hdiutil` (DMG creation), `sips` (icon resampling),
and `iconutil` (`.icns` packaging). All three ship with Xcode CLI tools.

SDL3 needs to be discoverable. The simplest setup: `brew install sdl3`. The
script auto-detects the Homebrew prefix and prepends it to `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`
so `find_package(SDL3)` resolves cleanly on both Apple Silicon (`/opt/homebrew`)
and Intel (`/usr/local`). CI uses `libsdl-org/setup-sdl` instead and points at
its own prefix — different machinery, same outcome.

DMG layout (mounted view):

```
LBA2 Classic Community <version>/
    lba2cc.app
    Applications -> /Applications   (drag-to-install symlink)
    README.txt
    LICENSE.txt
```

The first-launch Gatekeeper friction (right-click → Open) is documented
in the README inside the DMG. Code signing + notarization are deferred
until the project gets an Apple Developer Program account.

## Windows release artifact (local dry-run)

Iterate on the Windows release ZIP locally without burning CI minutes:

```bash
bash scripts/dev/build-windows-release.sh
```

The script auto-detects the build environment:

- **MSYS2 (UCRT64 / MINGW64)** — uses the matching native preset, produces an `x64` artifact. This is the recommended local path because it's bit-for-bit the same toolchain the CI release workflow (B2) uses, and SDL3 is straightforward (`pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-SDL3`).
- **Linux (incl. WSL)** — falls back to the `cross_linux2win` preset, produces an `i686` (32-bit) artifact. Cheap if you have `mingw-w64` already installed, but **also requires SDL3 for the i686 cross-arch**, which most distros don't ship by default. CI handles this via `setup-sdl`; on a dev box you'd typically just use MSYS2 instead.

Override the preset explicitly with `--preset windows_ucrt64`, `--preset windows_mingw64`, etc. if you want to test a specific configuration regardless of host environment.

Both paths invoke the same `scripts/packaging/bundle-windows.sh`, so the ZIP layout cannot drift between local dry-run and CI. The CI release workflow (B2, separate PR) calls the same script.

Prerequisites:

- `cmake`, `ninja` — both paths.
- Either `zip` or `python3` for the archive step (script falls back to `python3 -m zipfile` if `zip` isn't installed).
- **MSYS2 path**: a working MSYS2 UCRT64 dev environment (the same one used for native dev builds).
- **Linux/WSL path**: `mingw-w64` (`apt install mingw-w64` on Debian/Ubuntu, `pacman -S mingw-w64-gcc` on Arch) plus SDL3 built or installed for i686.

ZIP layout:

```
lba2cc-<version>-windows-<arch>/
    lba2cc.exe        ← static-linked: no SDL3.dll, no MSYS2 runtime DLLs
    README.txt        ← CRLF line endings, populated from
                        scripts/packaging/windows-readme.txt.in
    LICENSE.txt       ← GPL-2.0 from repo root, CRLF
```

`-arch` is `i686` for the local cross-compile dry-run, `x64` for the
native MSYS2 UCRT64 release workflow. The bundle script's DLL audit
flags any non-system DLL dependency that slipped through static linking.

To produce a *non-static* dev build that matches the day-to-day MSYS2
workflow, use the regular preset and skip this script — it's purely a
release-packaging path.

## What `git-cliff` reads

- Commit messages on `main` since the previous tag.
- Conventional-commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `port:`, `docs:`, ...) drive
  the section grouping. See `cliff.toml` and the
  [Commit & PR conventions](../AGENTS.md#commit--pr-conventions) section in
  AGENTS.md.
- One entry per PR. Cliff queries the GitHub API for each commit on `main`
  to resolve its associated PR (number + title) and renders one line per
  PR. Works identically for squash-merge, merge-commit, and rebase modes —
  the merge mode doesn't matter, the PR title does. The PR-title CI check
  (`.github/workflows/pr-title.yml`) is what keeps the log clean enough.
- A small `commit_preprocessors` rule rewrites GitHub's default merge
  subject (`Merge pull request #N from owner/branch`) into the
  conventional-commit-formatted PR title that GitHub puts on the third
  line of the body. This lets the type-based grouping (Added / Fixed /
  ...) work correctly for merge-commit-mode PRs.
- **`chore:` is the explicit "skip from changelog" prefix.** Use it for
  housekeeping PRs (formatting, internal refactors that aren't worth
  surfacing to readers, tooling fixes). Cliff drops them entirely.
- The `[remote.github]` block in `cliff.toml` enables author handle
  lookup via the GitHub API (`commit.remote.username`). Each entry then
  ends with ` — by @handle` linking to the author's profile. If the API
  call is unauthenticated and rate-limited, cliff falls back to the git
  author name — exporting `GITHUB_TOKEN` (above) avoids that.
