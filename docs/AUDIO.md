# Audio System

## Overview

The original LBA2 used the proprietary **Miles Sound System (MSS)** for audio. This project replaces Miles with an open-source **SDL-based backend** that implements the same **AIL (Audio Interface Library)** contract the engine was built against.

The SDL backend matches the AIL function signatures and handle semantics, but targets modern hardware and sound quality (44100 Hz, float mixing, clean clipping). This document describes the audio architecture, the AIL contract, how the engine uses audio, and current status.

---

## Architecture

The game's audio call chain is layered and already has a clean abstraction boundary:

```
Engine code (SOURCES/*.CPP)
    |  calls HQ functions and music/jingle functions
    v
HQ layer (AMBIANCE.CPP, MUSIC.CPP)
    |  game-level logic: 3D pan, volume scaling, "always" samples,
    |  music/jingle lifecycle, fade timing
    v
AIL functions (LIB386/AIL/)
    |  backend boundary -- swapped at compile time via SOUND_BACKEND
    |
    +-- SDL   (LIB386/AIL/SDL/)     -- current default, what we are hardening
    +-- MILES (LIB386/AIL/MILES/)   -- original proprietary implementation (reference)
    +-- NULL  (LIB386/AIL/NULL/)    -- silent stubs for testing
```

**Key principle: engine code changes are minimised.** The AIL headers define the contract. Any backend implements those headers. The CMake `SOUND_BACKEND` option (`null`, `miles`, `sdl`) selects which implementation is linked. This design is also reusable for LBA1 (same AIL interface). Engine-side changes are only made when the original code contains latent bugs that interact with the new backend (see [Engine-side fixes](#engine-side-fixes-sourcessourcesambiance.cpp) below).

The debug console commands (`playsample`, `playmusic`, `audio sample/music/global`, etc.) call the same HQ/AIL/music functions the engine uses -- no wrapper layer, no indirection. Backend diagnostic logging can be toggled at runtime via `audio global log <0|1>`. Use `audio global status` to inspect `samplesPaused` ref-count and driver state without needing log mode.

## The AIL contract

These are the C headers every backend must implement. They live in `LIB386/H/AIL/`.

## Sound scripting patterns

This section maps how the engine uses the AIL API in gameplay. It guides targeted testing and helps identify mix-sensitive scenes.

### 1. 3D mix calls (`HQ_3D_MixSample`, `HQ_3D_ChangePanSample`)

**Where:** INVENT, FICHE, BUGGY, IMPACT, EXTRA, OBJECT, PERSO, GERELIFE, GERETRAK, DART.

**Flow:**
1. `HQ_3D_MixSample(numsample, frequence, decalage, repeat, x, y, z)` projects 3D position to screen via `PtrProjectPoint`.
2. `GiveBalance(Xp, Yp, distance, &pan, &volume)` computes pan (0–127) and volume (0–127):
   - **Interior:** `distance = Distance2D(320, 240, Xp, Yp)`; volume falls off within `DISTANCE_SAMPLE_MAX` (700).
   - **Exterior:** `distance = Distance3D(x,y,z, CameraX,Y,Z)`; volume full within `DISTANCE_SAMPLE_MIN_EXT` (5000), fades to 0 by `DISTANCE_SAMPLE_MAX_EXT` (30000).
3. Calls `HQ_MixSample` with computed pan/volume.
4. If `GiveBalance` returns FALSE (off-screen) and `repeat==0`, returns synthetic handle `numsample<<8` for "always" samples.

**Typical parameters:** `frequence=0x1000` (normal pitch), `decalage=0` or 300–2000 (random pitch), `repeat=0` (loop) or `1` (one-shot).

### 2. Always-playing samples (`SampleAlways`)

**Where:** FICHE (object scripts), BUGGY, PERSO, GERELIFE (`LM_SAMPLE_ALWAYS`), GERETRAK (`TM_SAMPLE_ALWAYS`).

**Pattern:**
- Stored in `ptrobj->SampleAlways` (handle or `numsample<<8`).
- **Repanning:** `SampleAlwaysMove` timer (every ~2 s) triggers `HQ_3D_ChangePanSample` when the object moves.
- **Restart:** If `!IsSamplePlaying(SampleAlways)`, call `HQ_3D_MixSample` with `repeat=0`.
- **Sample change:** If new sample ID differs, `HQ_StopOneSample` old handle first.
- **Stop:** `HQ_StopOneSample(SampleAlways)` when object deactivates (e.g. get off buggy, stop protopack).

**Examples:**
- **Buggy engine** (`SAMPLE_BUGGY`): looping, `ChangePitchbendSample` for speed.
- **Protopack** (`SAMPLE_PROTOPACK`): looping while flying.
- **Object scripts:** ambient loops (machinery, water, etc.) tied to objects.

### 3. Ambience loops (`LaunchAmbiance`, `GereAmbiance`)

**Data source:** Scene file per cube. `SampleAmbiance[0..3]`, `SampleRepeat[0..3]`, `SampleRnd`, `SampleFreq`, `SampleVol`, `SecondMin`, `SecondEcart` loaded in `DISKFUNC.CPP`.

**LaunchAmbiance (on cube enter):**
- For each slot `n` with `SampleAmbiance[n] != -1` and `repeat==0`: start infinite loop immediately via `HQ_MixSample(numsample, freq, decal, 0, 64, volume)`.

**GereAmbiance (per-frame):**
- When `TimerNextAmbiance` fires: pick random slot, if `repeat!=0` and `!IsSamplePlaying(numsample)`, play one-shot with random pan.
- `SecondMin` + `SecondEcart` control interval between one-shots.

**ClearAmbiance (on cube change):** `HQ_StopOneSample` for each defined slot.

**Mix-sensitive:** Desert exterior cubes (White Leaf Desert, Island 2) typically use cicada-like samples in `SampleAmbiance` slots. Interior cubes may use machinery, water drips, etc.

### 4. Rain sample (`SAMPLE_RAIN`)

**Where:** `AMBIANCE.CPP` — `StartRainSample`, `ChoicePalette`, `GereRain`-related paths.

**Conditions:**
- `CubeMode==CUBE_EXTERIEUR` AND `!TEMPETE_FINIE` (storm active).
- Stopped when `CubeMode==CUBE_INTERIEUR` OR `TEMPETE_FINIE`.

**Pattern:** `HQ_MixSample(SAMPLE_RAIN, 0x1000, 300, 0, 64, volume)` — infinite loop, center pan, decalage 300 for variation.

### 5. Escalator (`SAMPLE_ESCALATOR`)

**Where:** `OBJECT.CPP` — `CJ_ESCALATOR_OUEST/EST/NORD/SUD`.

**Pattern:** `if (!IsSamplePlaying(SAMPLE_ESCALATOR)) HQ_MixSample(SAMPLE_ESCALATOR, 0x1000, 0, 1, 64, VOLUME_ESCALATOR)`.
- One-shot (`repeat=1`) but re-triggered each frame while on conveyor. Anti-spam via `IsSamplePlaying` + `SAMPLE_TIME_REPEAT` in `HQ_MixSample`.
- Non-3D, center pan.

### 6. Non-3D one-shots

**Examples:**
- `PlayErrorSample` macro: `SAMPLE_ERROR`, center pan, volume 127.
- `SAMPLE_BONUS`, `SAMPLE_FOUND_OBJ`, `SAMPLE_GAME_OVER`: UI/feedback.
- `SAMPLE_DEAD`, `SAMPLE_EXPLO_*`, `SAMPLE_BONUS_TROUVE`: 3D-positioned in EXTRA/OBJECT.

### 7. Protection alarm (INVENT)

**Pattern:** 3D-positioned `SAMPLE_PROTECTION` / `SAMPLE_PROTECTION_ALARME`, always-playing when zone active. `HQ_3D_ChangePanSample` on position update.

## Mix-sensitive scenes

| Scene type | Cubes | Notes |
|------------|-------|------|
| **Desert exterior** | 55–73, 198–220 (White Leaf Desert) | `SampleAmbiance[0..3]` from scene file — cicadas, wind, ambient. Often multiple infinite loops. |
| **Rain / storm** | Exterior cubes when `TEMPETE_ACTIVE` | `SAMPLE_RAIN` overlay on ambience. |
| **Escalator buildings** | e.g. baggage claim (5, 6, 16) | Conveyor belt + ambience. |
| **Protection zones** | Various | Continuous alarm + other SFX. |
| **Buggy / Protopack** | Desert, exterior | `SampleAlways` engine/jetpack + ambience + possible music. |
| **Crowded interiors** | Bazaar (36), Bar (39), etc. | Multiple objects with `SampleAlways`, ambience slots. |

**Testing focus:** Desert exterior (e.g. cube 56 "Near the Camel", 60 "Near J. Baldino's House") for cicada loops; storm scenes for rain overlay; escalator scenes for conveyor anti-spam; protection zones for 3D panning of continuous alarm.

---

## Principles

- **API parity, modern implementation.** Match the AIL function signatures and handle semantics. Leverage modern hardware (44100 Hz, float mixing, clean clipping) rather than replicating 1990s limitations.

- **Correctness first.** Handle semantics, voice lifecycle, threading safety, and buffer management must be right before anything else.

- **Voice priority** (when 12 voices are exhausted): dialogue and UI first, then character/environmental SFX, then ambience loops, then flavour. Ambience creates mood but must never drown critical sounds.

- **Minimal engine changes.** Backend work stays in `LIB386/AIL/SDL/`. Engine files in `SOURCES/` are only modified for latent bugs exposed by the new backend, documented below.

---

## Diagnostic logging

All audio diagnostic logging lives at the **AIL boundary** (`LIB386/AIL/SDL/`). Engine files are not instrumented -- logging is toggled via the console and stays in the backend layer.

### Output

Logging uses `SDL_Log()`, which outputs to stderr/NSLog (the timestamped console output). This is **separate** from the engine's `adeline.log` (`~/Library/Application Support/Twinsen/LBA2/adeline.log`), which uses `LogPrintf()`.

### Toggle

- **Console:** `audio global log <0|1>` toggles all backend logging at runtime.
- **Contract surface:** Only `SfxLogEnable`/`SfxLogIsEnabled` (SAMPLE.H) are in the AIL contract. Internally, SDL's `SfxLogEnable` also toggles `musicLogEnabled` (STREAM.CPP) and CD logging via `MusicLogIsEnabled()` -- this wiring stays inside `LIB386/AIL/SDL/` and does not add functions to the contract or require stubs in other backends.

### Coverage

Every public AIL function in the SDL backend is logged when enabled:

| File | Logged functions |
|------|-----------------|
| **SAMPLE.CPP** | `PlaySample` (ALLOC/STEAL/REJECTED), `SetMasterVolumeSample`, `ChangeVolumePanSample`, `ChangePitchbendSample`, `StopOneSample`, `StopSamples`, `PauseSamples`, `ResumeSamples`, `FadeOutSamples`, `FadeInSamples` |
| **STREAM.CPP** | `OpenStream`, `PlayStream`, `ChangeVolumeStream`, `StopStream`, `PauseStream`, `ResumeStream` |
| **CD.CPP** | `PlayCD`, `ChangeVolumeCD`, `StopCD`, `PauseCD`, `ResumeCD` |

Trivial getters (`IsSamplePlaying`, `GetVolumeCD`, `GetVolumeStream`, `IsCDPlaying`, `IsStreamPlaying`) are not logged to avoid noise.

### Tags

All log lines are prefixed with a channel tag for grep filtering:

- `[SFX]` -- sample operations (SAMPLE.CPP)
- `[MUSIC]` -- stream operations (STREAM.CPP)
- `[CD]` -- CD operations (CD.CPP)

## Engine-side fixes

These changes were made in engine code because they fix latent bugs exposed by the SDL backend's stricter semantics. Each is documented here with rationale.

### `SOURCES/AMBIANCE.CPP`

| Change | Original behaviour | Problem with SDL backend | Fix |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----|
| **`DelBlocHQRSample`: removed `HQ_StopSample()`** | Called `HQ_StopSample()` ("methode violente") on every HQR cache eviction, killing all playing voices. | SDL copies sample data (`malloc`+`memcpy`), so voices are independent of HQR cache entries. The blanket stop caused voice thrashing that silenced thunder and other concurrent SFX. | Removed `HQ_StopSample()`. Only `RestartRainSample = TRUE` remains to re-trigger rain after eviction. |
| **`ClearAmbiance`: added rain stop** | Only stopped the 4 `SampleAmbiance[]` slots. | With `DelBlocHQRSample` no longer killing all voices, rain could persist across cube transitions. | Added `HQ_StopOneSample(SAMPLE_RAIN)` before the ambiance slot loop. |
| **`StartRainSample`: added `Island==0` guard** | Checked `CubeMode==CUBE_EXTERIEUR AND !TEMPETE_FINIE`. | `RestartRainSample` fires on every HQR eviction regardless of island, causing rain on desert islands. The storm system only runs on Citadel Island (Island 0), matching `ChoicePalette`'s existing `Island==0` logic. | Added `Island==0` to the condition. |

### `SOURCES/GAMEMENU.CPP`

| Change | Original behaviour | Problem with SDL backend | Fix |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----|
| **`new_game:` added `HQ_ResumeSamples()`** | The `new_game:` path ran `Introduction()` then entered `MainLoop()` without unpausing samples. | The SDL backend reference-counts `samplesPaused`. The menu calls `HQ_PauseSamples()` before showing. `PlayAcf` (inside `Introduction`) pairs its own pause/resume, but the menu's pause is never reversed, leaving `samplesPaused == 1` when `MainLoop()` starts — the mix callback returns early and all SFX are silent. The `load_game:` path already had the matching `HQ_ResumeSamples()`. | Added `HQ_ResumeSamples()` after `HQ_StopSample()`, matching `load_game:`. |
| **Case 70 else (resume from autosave) added `HQ_ResumeSamples()`** | After GameOver (`firstloop = TRUE`), selecting "reprendre partie" loaded CURRENTSAVE and entered `MainLoop()` without unpausing. | Same ref-counted `samplesPaused` issue: the menu's `HQ_PauseSamples()` is never reversed on this path, silencing all SFX. | Added `HQ_ResumeSamples()` before `RestoreTimer()`, matching `load_game:`. |
| **Master volume handler: added `SetVolumeJingle`** | Master volume slider only called `SetMasterVolumeSample` and `SetVolumeCD`. | All music routes through the jingle/stream path (not CD). Changing master volume had no effect on music because `SetVolumeJingle` was never called, and `SetVolumeCD` is a no-op when `cdPlaying` is false. | Added `SetVolumeJingle(JingleVolume)` to both left/right master volume cases so master volume scales music. |
|| **`GereVolumeMenu`: resume samples for SFX/Voice tests** | Volume menu entered while `samplesPaused > 0` (from `HQ_PauseSamples` when ESC opens menu from game). | The SDL backend pauses the sample audio device when `samplesPaused > 0`. SFX and Voice test sounds in the volume menu are allocated but inaudible because the device callback never runs. | Added `ResumeSamples()` on entry (when `GetSamplesPausedCount() > 0`) and matching `PauseSamples()` on exit. Restores `SetVolumeJingle(JingleVolume)` on exit to undo any CD slider override. |
|| **CD volume slider: added `SetVolumeJingle`** | CD slider called `SetVolumeCD(CDVolume)` only. | All music routes through jingles, so `cdPlaying` is always 0 and `ChangeVolumeCD` is a no-op. The CD test music plays as a jingle but adjusting CDVolume has no audible effect. | Added `SetVolumeJingle(CDVolume)` after `SetVolumeCD(CDVolume)` so the stream responds to the CD slider. |

### `SOURCES/MUSIC.H`

| Change | Original behaviour | Problem with SDL backend | Fix |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----|
| **`SetVolumeJingle` macro: added MasterVolume scaling** | `SetVolumeJingle(vol)` expanded to `ChangeVolumeStream(vol)` — no master scaling. In the original, jingles were short ADPCM clips; CD audio (the real background music) was scaled by master via `SetVolumeCD`. | All music now routes through jingle/stream (Steam/GOG has no CD). Without master scaling, jingle volume was independent of master — adjusting master volume didn't change music loudness. | Changed to `ChangeVolumeStream(RegleTrois(0, MasterVolume, 127, vol))`, matching `SetVolumeCD`'s pattern. |

### `SOURCES/MUSIC.CPP`

| Change | Original behaviour | Problem with SDL backend | Fix |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----|
| **`TrackCD[6]`: added `JINGLE` flag** | Entry 6 (menu theme, music number 8) had no `JINGLE` flag, routing it through `PlayCD()`. | `PlayCD` constructs `Track08.wav` using physical CD track numbers. The Steam/GOG distribution names its music files `track1.ogg`–`track6.ogg` (sequential, no zero-padding). No filename permutation bridges this numbering gap. | Added `JINGLE` flag so the menu theme routes through `PlayJingle` → `PlayStream`, which has OGG fallback. |
| **`ListJingle[7]`: set to `"TADPCM6"`** | Empty string (`""`), because the menu theme was a physical CD audio track with no ADPCM stream. | With the `JINGLE` flag added above, `PlayJingle(8)` looks up `ListJingle[7]`, which was empty. | Set to `"TADPCM6"` following the existing TADPCM naming pattern. The stream layer's `track<N>.ogg` fallback resolves this to `track6.ogg`. |
| **`FadeOutVolumeMusic`: use `ChangeVolumeStream` directly** | Fade-out loop called `SetVolumeJingle(jvolume)` where `jvolume` was derived from `GetVolumeStream()` (already a raw stream value). | With `SetVolumeJingle` now applying MasterVolume scaling, the intermediate fade values would be double-scaled. | Changed to `ChangeVolumeStream(jvolume)` for the fade loop and final zero-set, avoiding double scaling. |

### `SOURCES/AMBIANCE.CPP`

| Change | Original behaviour | Problem with SDL backend | Fix |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----|
| **`ReadVolumeSettings`: reordered volume application** | `SetVolumeJingle(JingleVolume)` was called before `MasterVolume` was read from config. | With `SetVolumeJingle` now scaling by MasterVolume, calling it before MasterVolume is loaded from config would use the wrong master value. | Moved `SetVolumeJingle` and `SetVolumeCD` calls to after `MasterVolume` is read and `SetMasterVolumeSample` is called. |

### `LIB386/AIL/SDL/STREAM.CPP`

| Change | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Added `track<N>.ogg` fallback** | The original TADPCM music files (`TADPCM1.WAV`–`TADPCM5.WAV`) were renamed to `track1.ogg`–`track6.ogg` in the Steam/GOG distribution. When `PlayStream` can't find the WAV or its direct OGG equivalent (e.g. `tadpcm1.ogg`), the fallback extracts the trailing number from the filename and probes `track<N>.ogg`. Backward compatible with original WAV files. |
