# Game data (retail files)

The engine needs the **original Little Big Adventure 2** data files. They are **not** included in this repository (licensing). You must own a legitimate copy (e.g. [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/little_big_adventure_2), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/398000/)).

## What to point the engine at

Use the directory that contains **`lba2.hqr`** (and the other `.hqr` files, `music/`, `video/`, `vox/`, etc.). On Steam, classic data may live under a **Classic**-related install path; remastered or other editions may use a different layout—this fork targets **classic** data only.

**Validation:** discovery and overrides only succeed when the chosen path is a directory that contains **`lba2.hqr`** (that is the required marker; see `IsValidResourceDir` / `FILE_VALID_RES_DIR` in `SOURCES/DIRECTORIES.CPP`). The filename is matched with the same case-folding logic as other asset files.

**Single asset root:** Once that directory is chosen, **`GetResPath`**, **`GetJinglePath`**, **`GetMoviePath`**, and related APIs resolve files **relative to that same `directoriesResDir`** (see `InitDirectories` / `GetResPath` in `SOURCES/DIRECTORIES.CPP`). The engine does not look for `music/`, `video/`, `vox/`, or other `.hqr` files on separate paths; finding **`lba2.hqr`** establishes the one root for classic data.

**Sibling scan:** If the fixed paths above fail, the engine looks at **siblings of the parent of the current working directory** (for example the folder that contains both your clone and a retail install). For each immediate subdirectory, it tries that folder and `CommonClassic`, `common`, `Common`, and `Classic` under it. Only **bounded** scans (entry and directory-count limits); see `TryParentSiblingScan` in `SOURCES/RES_DISCOVERY.CPP`.

## Overrides (highest priority first)

| Mechanism | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Command line | `./lba2 --game-dir /path/to/game` or `--data-dir` (alias) |
| Environment | `export LBA2_GAME_DIR=/path/to/game` |
| Discovery | See [SOURCES/RES_DISCOVERY.CPP](../SOURCES/RES_DISCOVERY.CPP): SDL binary directory, current working directory, parents of cwd, `./data`, `../LBA2`, `../game`, sibling scan of parent-of-cwd |

If no valid directory is found, the process exits with a log listing **candidates tried** and hints.

**Explicit path (recommended for anything non-local):** Use **`--game-dir`** or **`LBA2_GAME_DIR`** when the install is not next to your working tree (another drive, `~/Games/…`, CI, etc.). That is the stable, portable option.

**What “adjacent” means in discovery:** Heuristics only look at **predictable relative locations** (cwd, parents of cwd, `../LBA2`, `./data`, SDL binary dir, then **siblings of the parent of cwd** with a small set of subfolder names). There is **no** full-disk or deep recursive search. **“Adjacent”** here means *often the same parent folder as your clone* when you run from the repo root—not “any path on the machine.”

**Safety:** Every candidate is accepted only if **`IsValidResourceDir`** succeeds (**`lba2.hqr`** present). There is no execution of paths from untrusted config beyond what you pass on the command line or in the environment.

## Developer layout

Common choices:

- Symlink or copy retail files into **`data/`** at the repo root (that directory is **gitignored** in this repo so retail files are not committed by mistake).
- One directory up: **`../LBA2/`** (or `../game/`) with `lba2.hqr` inside.

From any directory in the clone you can use:

```bash
./scripts/dev/build-and-run.sh
```

or **`make run`** (see [Makefile](../Makefile)). Set **`LBA2_BUILD_DIR`** if you do not use `build/`.

Windows without Bash: configure CMake as in [WINDOWS.md](WINDOWS.md), then run `lba2.exe` with `--game-dir` or set `LBA2_GAME_DIR` in the environment.

## Config file

See [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md). If `lba2.cfg` is missing from the **user** config folder, the engine copies from the asset directory when present; if the asset directory has no `lba2.cfg`, an **embedded** template (from the build) is written instead.
