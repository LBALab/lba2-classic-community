# Changelog

All notable changes to the LBA2 Classic Community engine fork.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> Engine semver is independent from `NUM_VERSION` (save-file on-disk format,

## [Unreleased]

_Changes accumulated since the fork was created. The first tagged release
will move this section to a dated heading. See
[docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for the cut recipe._

The list below is hand-curated from merged PRs and tells the story of the
fork's evolution. Future entries are auto-generated from conventional
commits by [`git-cliff`](https://git-cliff.org/).

> **Highlights since the fork**
>
> The biggest architectural shift is portability. The playable game now
> builds **without an ASM toolchain** — pure C/C++ on the build path,
> linked against SDL3 and `libsmacker`. The original 16/32-bit x86
> assembly is still in the tree (it remains the source of truth and is
> required to run the ASM↔C++ equivalence tests), but it is **no longer
> in the build path of the playable binary**. Combined with the SDL3
> port, this unlocked native builds for **Linux x86_64**, **macOS
> arm64/x86_64**, and **Windows (MSYS2 UCRT64)**, and keeps the door
> open to other SDL platforms.

### Stability & 64-bit hardening
