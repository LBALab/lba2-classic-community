## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-17

### New features (opt-in)

- Cross-platform first-launch folder picker: when no retail game data is
  found via the usual discovery paths (`./data`, `../LBA2`,
  `LBA2_GAME_DIR`, `--game-dir`), the engine now prompts for the
  install folder via the native system file dialog instead of exiting
  with an error. Picked path is persisted to a user-config file for
  next run; pass `--pick-game-dir` to force the picker again. Works on
  Windows, macOS, and Linux (zenity / xdg-desktop-portal-* on Linux,
  with explanatory fallback text when no backend is installed)
  ([#107](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/issues/107),
  [#111](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/111)).
- Save/load list now navigable with gamepad D-pad
  ([#79](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/79)).
- Auto-named saves for gamepad users: gamepad input on the save-name
  prompt skips text entry and writes a scene-aware default name in the
  form `<scene> - YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS` (e.g. `Citadel Island - 2026-05-17 14-30-00`).
  The scene portion is localised across the six menu languages (sourced
  from the retail `TEXT.HQR` file 2); the date/time portion is fixed
  `%Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S`. Long names clip with a marquee in the save list;
  post-save success chime + "Game saved" overlay
  ([#151](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/151)).
- Console `give` command now actually grants inventory items instead of
  only playing the found-object cinematic. It takes an item name
  (`give conch`), with the numeric index still accepted as a fallback;
  run `give` with no arguments to list every item name. Countable items
  accept an optional count (`give gem 5`, `give money 5000`,
  `give clover 3`)
  ([#143](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/143)) —
  see [docs/CONSOLE.md](docs/CONSOLE.md).
- Console `slide` command jumps directly to a distributor/bumper slide
  (Adeline, EA, etc.); companion `distrib` command lists the available
  slide IDs
  ([#116](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/116)).

### Stability & fixes

- `ScaleSprite` scaled path restored. A 2024 ASM→CPP port had stripped
  the scaled-output branches, leaving the function effectively unscaled
  for months. The most visible symptom in-game: world-space sprites that
  should shrink with distance no longer did — the magic ball, for
  example, stayed the same size as it flew away from Twinsen in exterior
  scenes instead of receding with distance. The regression went unnoticed
  because the existing test only varied numerator/x/y, not the scale
  factor. Mirrored back from `SCALESPT` ASM, and the test matrix extended
  to cover factor sweeps
  ([#148](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/148)).
- `TempoRealAngle` extern conflict in savegame load: `DEBUG_TOOLS=ON`
  builds failed to compile because PR #62's stride-retry refactor
  introduced a wrong-typed `extern S32 TempoRealAngle` next to the
  existing file-scope `T_REAL_VALUE_HR` definition. Default builds were
  unaffected (the block is `#if`-gated out). Fix removes the redundant
  extern
  ([#146](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/146)).
- `GereExtras` no longer reads uninitialised old-position memory
  ([#142](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/142)).
- Undefined-behaviour hardening pass from the static-analysis sweep:
  shift-by-32 UB in the `POLYGOUR` dither rotate, signed-overflow in
  `I_WEAPON_7` / `A_FLIP` bit masks, and `TheEndCheckFile` marked
  `noreturn` to close null-deref paths flagged downstream
  ([#140](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/140)).
- `deffile` config parser: signed-`char` EOL desync and self-aliasing
  `strcpy` cleaned up. Bug A was user-reported: a `lba2.cfg` containing
  `Language: Français` (or any other Latin-1 high-bit byte) corrupted on
  successive rewrites — 21 stray `çais` lines spliced in and all 144
  keyboard + gamepad bindings reset to zero. Bug B was an overlapping
  `strcpy(FileName, file)` caught by ASan against the GOG TLBA2 Classic
  package on shutdown. Both were old, both UB. Host-only regression
  test added under `host_quick`
  ([#115](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/issues/115),
  [#132](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/132)).
- Terrain vertex projection: dropped the no-op / off-by-one `+0.5`
  rounding bias that desynced terrain vertex positions from the rest
  of the scene
  ([#145](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/145)).

### Refactoring

- Framebuffer dimensions extracted to `RESOLUTION_X` / `RESOLUTION_Y`
  in a new `LIB386/H/SYSTEM/RESOLUTION.H`. Cinema bars and sort-tree
  preclip now route through `ModeDesiredX/Y` instead of hardcoded
  `640`/`480`. Foundation for the widescreen / higher-resolution
  rendering work
  ([#134](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/134)).

### Game data, config, and UX

- `lba2.cfg` defaults modernised for the open-source era: fullscreen on
  by default (`DisplayFullScreen=1`), Version row defaults tightened to
  match the shipping engine
  ([#117](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/117)).

### Tools

- `scripts/dev/extract_lba2_gog_media.py` extracts the retail media tree
  from the GOG Original Edition `LBA2.GOG` bin/cue image (ISO9660 reader
  with no external `mount`/`isoinfo` dependency). Lets users with the
  GOG install seed `./data` without owning the original CDs
  ([#119](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/issues/119),
  [#123](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/123)).

### Cross-platform & build

- macOS native release artifact: a portable DMG with the `.app` bundle
  inside, drag-to-Applications layout, native multi-resolution `.icns`
  icon, and an `Info.plist` populated from the same `LBA2_*` cache vars
  that drive the runtime window title, `.desktop` entry, AppImage labels,
  and Windows resource. Built for arm64 (Apple Silicon) on tag push;
  static-linked SDL3, no `.dylib` dependencies, ad-hoc codesigned to
  satisfy Apple Silicon's mandatory bundle integrity check. First launch
  still needs the right-click → Open Gatekeeper bypass (Developer ID +
  notarization deferred); documented in the README inside the DMG, and
  the Sequoia (15+) `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` recovery flow is
  spelled out in [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md). Intel-Mac users
  can produce a local DMG via
  `scripts/dev/build-macos-release.sh --preset macos_x86_64` while
  hosted Intel runners are unreliable
  ([#102](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/102),
  [#103](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/103),
  [#105](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/105),
  [#106](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/106),
  [#149](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/149)).
- Linux binary tarball release artifact alongside the AppImage: same
  static-linked single-binary layout, drop-in for distros where AppImage
  FUSE is a hassle. `libxtst-dev` added to the tarball build deps after
  the first CI run surfaced the missing X11 link
  ([#124](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/124),
  [#125](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/125)).
- Post-release smoke-test script (`scripts/dev/verify-release.sh`)
  downloads each published Linux artifact, runs the discovery
  self-tests, and reports per-asset pass/fail. Pointers added to the
  releasing recipe and announcement steps
  ([#126](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/126),
  [#127](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/127)).
- Rolling `latest` pre-release: every push to `main` triggers a CI build
  of all three platforms (Linux AppImages, Windows ZIP, macOS DMG) and
  force-updates a `latest`-tagged GitHub Release. Marked pre-release; the
  most recent stable tag keeps GitHub's "Latest" promotion. Lets community
  testers grab bleeding-edge main builds without cloning + building
  ([#108](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/108)) —
  see [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) "Rolling latest pre-release".
- Release workflow hardening: low-friction release-target additions,
  CI path filters so doc-only pushes skip the heavy matrix, pinned
  `setup-sdl` SHA + per-arch cache discriminator after a stale-cache
  drift incident
  ([#129](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/129),
  [#130](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/130)).

### CI & developer workflow

- `clang-tidy` static-analysis pass wired into CI, with a tuned
  check-list that silences bulk-noise categories (Watcom-era idioms,
  C-style casts in ported code) while keeping the high-signal UB /
  memory-safety / portability checks. The first analysis pass produced
  the UB-hardening fixes listed above
  ([#139](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/139),
  [#141](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/141)).
- Docs-only gate for the required build/test checks so README/CHANGELOG
  edits don't block on the full matrix
  ([#136](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/136)).
- Optional `pre-commit` hook running `check-format.sh` for contributors
  who'd rather catch clang-format mismatches locally than in CI
  ([#133](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/133)).

### Documentation

- [docs/WIDESCREEN.md](docs/WIDESCREEN.md) — phased plan (A–E) for the
  widescreen / higher-resolution work, with the framebuffer-extraction
  refactor above as its first landed phase
  ([#135](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/135)).
- [docs/CI.md](docs/CI.md) — map of the CI workflow surface (matrix
  builds, gates, release flow) so contributors can reason about a
  failing job without spelunking the YAML
  ([#137](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/137)).
- [docs/SPRITES.md](docs/SPRITES.md) — sprite/blit pipeline reference,
  including the `ScaleSprite` path layout and the test gap that hid the
  scaled-path regression for months.
- [docs/AUDIO.md](docs/AUDIO.md) extended with the retail audio asset
  inventory: what's ADPCM-WAV, what's MIDI, and which backend owns
  which path.

### Contributors

Welcome to a new contributor since v0.9.0:
[@b-tuma](https://github.com/b-tuma) — gamepad D-pad navigation for the
save/load list ([#79](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/79)).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-09

First tagged release. Cross-platform builds (Linux AppImage, Windows ZIP)
published at
[v0.9.0](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/releases/tag/v0.9.0).

The list below is hand-curated from merged PRs and tells the story of the
fork's evolution.

> **Highlights since the fork**
>
> The biggest architectural shift is portability. The playable game now
> builds as pure C/C++ against SDL3 and `libsmacker`, with no ASM
> toolchain on the build path. The original 16/32-bit x86 assembly is
> still in the tree as the source of truth and powers the ASM↔C++
> equivalence tests, but it no longer runs in the playable binary.
> Native builds for Linux x86_64, macOS arm64/x86_64, and Windows
> (MSYS2 UCRT64). Community members are already running it on handheld
> devices in the wild.

  [#66](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/66))
- Legacy 32-bit `.lba` saves load safely on 64-bit builds, with a corpus
  harness to prevent regressions
  ([#62](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/issues/62),
  [#63](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/63))
- 32-bit on-disk ABI rule and credits HQR layout codified in docs

### New features (opt-in)

All new features default-off or default-to-original-behavior, in line with
[AGENTS.md Principle 3](AGENTS.md#principles).

- Quake-style debug console: built-in, always available, configurable
  toggle key, host-tested
  ([#23](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/issues/23),
  [#24](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/24),
  [#60](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/60)) —

  ([#37](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/issues/37),
  [#50](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/50)) —
  see [docs/CAMERA.md](docs/CAMERA.md)
- Menu mouse QoL: hover, selection, marquee for long text, keyboard
  takes priority over mouse hover
  ([#41](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/41),
  [#53](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/53),
  [#56](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/56))

  [#22](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/22)) —
  see [docs/DEBUG.md](docs/DEBUG.md)

### Game data, config, and UX

- Auto-discovery of retail game data (`./data`, `../LBA2`,
  `LBA2_GAME_DIR`, `--game-dir`); embedded default config; clearer
  startup errors
  ([#54](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/54)) —
  see [docs/GAME_DATA.md](docs/GAME_DATA.md)
- Menus reorganized to match LBA2 Original from GOG
  ([#42](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/42))
- Menu language selection

- Menu music and jingle handling — fixed
  ([#43](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/issues/43))
- Case-sensitive music paths on Linux — fixed
  ([#12](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/12))

### Audio/video backends
- SDL audio backend with Miles parity gap tracking
  ([#27](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/issues/27),
  [#28](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/28),
  [#9](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/9))
- SDL renderer presentation path with LTO and inline rotates
  ([#11](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/11),
  [#51](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/51))
- Early SDL bring-up for renderer/audio in the fork's first
  cross-platform phase, plus follow-up SDL3 AIL-linking fixes
  ([#6](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/6),
  [#9](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/9),
  [#11](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/11),
  [e9ba7d8](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/commit/e9ba7d8))
- Smacker FMV via libsmacker; video audio routed through the AIL backend
  ([#10](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/10),
  [#29](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/issues/29),
  [#35](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/35))

### Ported (ASM → C++)

- Object display, rendering helpers, and supporting math via the
  ASM-validation framework, with byte-for-byte equivalence tests
  ([#31](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/31),
  [#32](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/32))
- Early renderer/SVGA/object-display ASM→CPP ports (polygon fillers,
  blitters/sprites, and object rendering), which established the base for
  later validation-driven porting work
  ([#6](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/6))
- See [docs/ASM_TO_CPP_REFERENCE.md](docs/ASM_TO_CPP_REFERENCE.md) for the
  full port-status table.

### Cross-platform & build

- First Linux release artifact: AppImage built in CI from an any-linux
  base, packaged as a single portable binary
  ([#74](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/74))
- First Windows release artifact: a portable ZIP (`lba2cc-<version>-windows-x64.zip`)
  built in CI under MSYS2 UCRT64 with SDL3 and the GCC C++ runtime
  static-linked. Drop the single `lba2cc.exe` into your existing LBA2
  install folder — no DLLs, no installer, no registry entries. Follows
  the same release-workflow conventions as the AppImage flow (matrix
  build → idempotent gh-release attach), see `docs/RELEASING.md`.
- Product metadata (executable name, display name, description, desktop
  ID) centralized into CMake cache variables so the runtime window
  title, `.desktop` entry, and AppImage script all consume one source
  ([#83](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/issues/83)).
  Window title now shows the version (e.g. `LBA2 Classic Community
  0.9.0-dev`) — previously just `LBA2`.
- Default binary renamed `lba2` → `lba2cc` to avoid colliding with the
  retail executables (`lba2.exe`, `tlba2.exe`, `tlba2c.exe`). Path is
  now `build/SOURCES/lba2cc[.exe]`. Override-able via
  `-DLBA2_EXECUTABLE_NAME=...` for anyone shipping a custom branded build.
- Windows `.exe` now ships with an embedded application icon and
  populated File Properties → Details (Product Name, File Description,
  Product Version, Original Filename). Strings flow from the same
  `LBA2_*` cache vars that feed the runtime window title, `.desktop`
  entry, and AppImage labels. Pre-release versions (anything carrying
  `-dev`/`-dirty`/`-rc` suffix) are flagged with `VS_FF_PRERELEASE` in
  `VERSIONINFO`.
- macOS CI build (arm64); macOS x86_64 preset
  ([#52](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/52))
- Portable Windows build via MSYS2 UCRT64
  ([#14](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/14)) —
  see [docs/WINDOWS.md](docs/WINDOWS.md)
- CMake presets for Linux, macOS arm64/x86_64, Windows UCRT64, and
  cross-compile Linux→Windows
  ([#21](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/21))
- SDL3 throughout (audio, video, renderer)
- Default Windows preset switched to Release
- `clang-format` with checked-in config; ASM and `LIB386/libsmacker/`
  excluded
  ([#36](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/36))
- Host-only discovery tests run on Linux/macOS/Windows in CI without
  Docker or retail files
  ([#54](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/54))

### Tests

- ASM↔CPP equivalence test framework with byte-for-byte assertions and
  randomized stress rounds
  ([#31](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/31)) —
  see [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)
- Polyrec replay with `--bisect` for finding the first divergent draw
  call between ASM and CPP renderers
- Tightened assertions across `POLYFLAT`, `POLYGOUR`, `POLYDISC`,
  `POLYTEXT`, `POLYGTEX`, `AFF_OBJ`, FPU precision, and the resampler
  ([#44](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/44))

### Pre-PR foundations

Most of what made this fork buildable and cross-platform predates the
PR workflow. The themes from that direct-commit era — CMake build
system and MinGW cross-compile to Windows ([@leokolln](https://github.com/leokolln)),
macOS M1 build, the bulk of the LIB386 ASM→C++ port, and the ASM↔CPP
equivalence test infrastructure ([@sergiou87](https://github.com/sergiou87)),
early renderer/SVGA/object-display ASM→CPP ports ([@xesf](https://github.com/xesf)),
all building on [@yaz0r](https://github.com/yaz0r)'s original buildable
prototype — are credited under Contributors below.

The earliest PR-tracked entries that sit alongside that work:

- File encoding preservation
  ([#1](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/1))
- Preservation docs and build configuration clarity

Special thanks to the contributors whose foundational work this fork stands on:

- [@sergiou87](https://github.com/sergiou87) — macOS M1 build, the bulk of the LIB386 ASM→C++ port, and the ASM↔CPP equivalence test infrastructure that makes the cross-platform port verifiable.
- [@leokolln](https://github.com/leokolln) — the cross-platform build foundation: CMake build system and presets, MinGW cross-compile to Windows, UASM ASM modernisation, 64-bit Linux preset, AIL sound backend structure, and Linux CI.
- [@xesf](https://github.com/xesf) — implementation work across SVGA, 3D object rendering, brick handling, and `AffString`, plus the CopyMask Tavern crash fix and widescreen Steam Deck work.
- [@yaz0r](https://github.com/yaz0r) — the original buildable prototype that the cross-platform fork was built on.

A big thank you to Gwen Gourevich ([@gwen-gg](https://github.com/gwen-gg)) and [2.21](https://discord.gg/e2ZXpzrM) for open-sourcing the original code, and to the original Adeline
Software team whose code this builds on.
