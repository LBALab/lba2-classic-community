# Changelog

All notable changes to the LBA2 Classic Community engine fork.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> Engine semver is independent from `NUM_VERSION` (save-file on-disk format,
> see `SOURCES/COMMON.H`). Save-format changes are tracked there, not here.

## [Unreleased]

_Changes accumulated since the fork was created. The first tagged release
will move this section to a dated heading. See
[docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for the cut recipe._

The list below is hand-curated from merged PRs and tells the story of the
fork's evolution.

> **Highlights since the fork**
>
> The biggest architectural shift is portability. The playable game now
> builds as pure C/C++ against SDL3 and `libsmacker`, with no ASM
> toolchain on the build path. The original 16/32-bit x86 assembly is
> still in the tree as the source of truth and powers the ASM↔C++
> equivalence tests, but it no longer runs in the playable binary.
> Native builds for Linux x86_64, macOS arm64/x86_64, and Windows
> (MSYS2 UCRT64). Community members are already running it on handheld
> devices in the wild.

### Stability & 64-bit hardening

- Magic-school grand-wizard crash on 64-bit hosts — fixed
  ([#78](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/issues/78),
  [#84](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/84)).
  U32+pointer-wraparound trap in `CopyMask`, pinned by a host-only
  regression test.
- Renderer-side U32+pointer-wrap class named, documented, and swept
  across ~80 files in SVGA, pol_work, 3D, 3DEXT, GRILLE, INTEXT — one
  bug fixed (above), six "safe by convention" latent traps recorded

  blitters/sprites, and object rendering), which established the base for
  later validation-driven porting work
  ([#6](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/6))
- See [docs/ASM_TO_CPP_REFERENCE.md](docs/ASM_TO_CPP_REFERENCE.md) for the

### Pre-PR foundations

Most of what made this fork buildable and cross-platform predates the
PR workflow. The themes from that direct-commit era — CMake build
system and MinGW cross-compile to Windows ([@leokolln](https://github.com/leokolln)),
macOS M1 build, the bulk of the LIB386 ASM→C++ port, and the ASM↔CPP
equivalence test infrastructure ([@sergiou87](https://github.com/sergiou87)),
early renderer/SVGA/object-display ASM→CPP ports ([@xesf](https://github.com/xesf)),
all building on [@yaz0r](https://github.com/yaz0r)'s original buildable
prototype — are credited under Contributors below.

The earliest PR-tracked entries that sit alongside that work:

- File encoding preservation
  ([#1](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/1))
- Preservation docs and build configuration clarity
  ([#13](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community/pull/13))

Special thanks to the contributors whose foundational work this fork stands on:

- [@sergiou87](https://github.com/sergiou87) — macOS M1 build, the bulk of the LIB386 ASM→C++ port, and the ASM↔CPP equivalence test infrastructure that makes the cross-platform port verifiable.
- [@leokolln](https://github.com/leokolln) — the cross-platform build foundation: CMake build system and presets, MinGW cross-compile to Windows, UASM ASM modernisation, 64-bit Linux preset, AIL sound backend structure, and Linux CI.
- [@xesf](https://github.com/xesf) — implementation work across SVGA, 3D object rendering, brick handling, and `AffString`, plus the CopyMask Tavern crash fix and widescreen Steam Deck work.
- [@yaz0r](https://github.com/yaz0r) — the original buildable prototype that the cross-platform fork was built on.

A big thank you to Gwen Gourevich ([@gwen-gg](https://github.com/gwen-gg)) and [2.21](https://discord.gg/e2ZXpzrM) for open-sourcing the original code, and to the original Adeline
Software team whose code this builds on.
